# Multi-Blockchain Wallet in Python

## Introduction

This is a basic multi blockchain wallet built in Python3 from hd-wallet-derive.

The primary function of the wallet is to allow transactions on a variety of block chains via unix CLI commands in Python.

### Functions

#### Derive wallets

This function takes in three parameters.
* mnenomic, this is the 12-word mnenomic used to generate the wallet.
* coin, this is the coin type. The coin types for this wallet are stored in constants.py. Currently eth and btc-test are supported. They are stored as ETH and BTCTEST.
* numderive, this parameter controls the number of child keys to generate.

The function will return a json containing the requested number of keys for a specific coin.

#### priv_key_to_account

This function converts a private key string into an account object which can be used by bit and web3


#### create_tx

This function will create a raw, unsigned transaction that contains the data needed to transact.
Generally you wouldn't call this function directly as it is called by the send_tx function.

It takes in 4 parameters coin, account, to, amount
* The coin that we are transacting
* An account object generated by the priv_key_to_account function.
* The account we are sending to.
* The amount of the coin we are sending.


#### send_tx

This is the primary sending function in the wallet. It's used to sign and send transactions. It calls the prior function create_tx. As a result, it calls the same parameters.
